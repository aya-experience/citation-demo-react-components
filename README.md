# Citation Demo

This project is the prototype of what will be the user project. It has to be the more simple possible.

It's based on the citation-react-router for connecting the routing to the Citation server.

## Tooling

The tooling is based on react-scripts using Babel, ESLint and Webpack.

## Libraries

Citation does not force the user to use any specific library like Redux. To illustrate this point, the project use the minimum library possible.

## Routing

The routing is fully managed by the CitationRouter from the citation-react-router lib. So it's a dependency of this project.

## Usage

To run the development server with live-reload:

```shell
npm run dev
```

To run the Citation server with its API, backoffice app, and this project statically generated.

```shell
npm start
```
